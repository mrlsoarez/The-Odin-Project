    <p> This is the begginner's project made for the Odin Project Curriculum - a simple display of Recipes made with the essentials of a webpage - <strong> HTML </strong>, <strong> CSS! </strong> and JS!<strong></strong> 
    <p>In this project, i learned and used for the first time:  </p>
    <ul>
        <li> CSS Events for interactive behavior</li>
        <li>JS dynamic display of elements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A interesting technique i applied also was the DIV hovering to show the information before displaying it completely! You can check it live here.: <a href = "#"></a></p>
